Despite of this, Canada have been taking excellent actions to avoid the same level of affections and this country, at this moment, has controlling the virus expansion in their territory.\n",

This will help to identify the best places where the newcomers can rent a house avoiding the worst areas. Of course, it is necessary to manipulate, normalize and merge the data from the both sources. \n",
